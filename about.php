<p style="width:800px; margin:0 auto; padding-bottom: 20px">​I love to read about peoples personal stories on their journey to better health so thought it was about time I shared a little of my own and why we started Vital Body Scan NZ.
   My own journey has seen me go from 87 kilos to 62 kilos. What I have learned is that it's not about that magic number on the scales anymore! 
   In 2014 we went to live in Australia for the year and came across a business called Rapid Bioscan, check them out if you are in Australia http://www.rapidbioscan.com.au/. They offered comprehensive reports on body composition so that you can look beyond your weight on the scale and track the numbers that really matter.

      <p>To be completely honest, when I was first scanned it was a shock to the system. 
         Having already used other BIA technology, I had a fair idea of where I was sitting 
         but was unaware of how inaccurate these can actually be.
         Having already lost 18kg I wasn’t feeling my heaviest at 69.5kg but could visibly see 
         that there was a lot of room for improvement.  After I had my first scan I could see that 
         I was still sitting at 35.7% body fat.  Instead of focusing on the negative (the dreaded body fat!) 
         they were able to show me that I had a good amount of muscle mass and there were other positive numbers 
         that ticked all the boxes.
